# Boggle-word-game
This project is a Python-based recreation of the classic Boggle word game with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. The game generates a randomized 4×4 letter board and challenges players to form valid words by selecting adjacent letters without reusing tiles.

Words are validated against an external dictionary file, and points are awarded based on standard Boggle scoring rules. The game runs within a fixed time limit, displaying a live countdown timer and locking the board when the round ends. Player progress, including discovered words and total score, is tracked and updated in real time.

This project demonstrates GUI development, event-driven programming, grid traversal logic, and effective use of Python data structures to build an interactive desktop application.
